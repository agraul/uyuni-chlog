#+title: =uyuni-chlog= - An Uyuni changelog helper for Emacs

=uyuni-chlog= is a helper that makes filling [[https://github.com/uyuni-project/uyuni/wiki/Contributing#changelogs][Uyuni changelog entries]] easy.
[[https://uyuni-project.org][Uyuni]] is developed in a [[https://github.com/uyuni-project/uyuni][monorepo]] and distributed as many RPM packages. As a
result, there are many different .changes tracked in the repository.
Nowadays, these changes files are not updated directly. In each Pull
Request, one new .changes file is added for each original .changes file.
Later on, all these .changes files are merged into the main ones.

uyuni-chlog automatically finds the correct changelog to update and shows a
prompt for the changelog entry.
